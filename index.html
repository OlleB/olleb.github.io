<p>I completed a PhD in Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 2013, in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences. My thesis is concerned with philosophical issues about cooperation and social cognition. It is entitled <em>Joint action without and beyond planning</em>. Since finishing my PhD, I have continued to do work in this area.</p>

<p>Generally, my research interests are in the philosophy of mind and action, and in the philosophy of cognitive science and social science. I have a keen interest in empirical work on joint action and social cognition.</p>

<p>As of January 2015, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://cfs.ku.dk/">Center for Subjectivity Research</a>, Department of Media, Cognition and Communication, University of Copenhagen, where I'm working on a project on intentional joint action and its relation to collective responsibility and agent's knowledge. The project is funded by a two-year DFF-MOBILEX Mobility Grant. I am also a member of the interdisciplinary <a href="http://www.fil.lu.se/en/research/research-groups/548">Metaphysics and Collectivity research group</a> hosted by the Department of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Lund University.</p>

<p>From January to July 2016, I'm a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Philosophy, Stanford University.</p>

<p>For more information about my research, see my <a href="http://lu.academia.edu/OlleBlomberg">academia.edu page</a> or my <a href="http://philpapers.org/profile/286">PhilPapers profile</a>.</p>

<p>I mainly use github for editing and version control philosophy papers I am working on. (I do not keep these in public repositories though.)</p>
