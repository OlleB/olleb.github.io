My thesis is concerned with philosophical issues about cooperation and social cognition. It is entitled _Joint action without and beyond planning_.\r\n\r\nMy research interests are mainly in the philosophy of mind and action, and in the philosophy of cognitive science and social science. I also have a keen interest in empirical work on joint action and social cognition.\r\n\r\n<K.J.O.Blomberg@sms.ed.ac.uk>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
